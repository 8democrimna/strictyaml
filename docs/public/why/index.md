StrictYAML is the result of some carefully considered, although
controversial design decisions. These are justified here.

- [What is wrong with duplicate keys?]()
- [What is wrong with explicit tags?]()
- [What is wrong with flow-style YAML?]()
- [The Norway Problem - why StrictYAML refuses to do implicit typing and so should you]()
- [What is wrong with node anchors and references?]()
- [Why does StrictYAML not parse direct representations of Python objects?]()
- [Why does StrictYAML only parse from strings and not files?]()
- [Why is parsing speed not a high priority for StrictYAML?]()
- [What is syntax typing?]()
- [Why does StrictYAML make you define a schema in Python - a Turing-complete language?]()
