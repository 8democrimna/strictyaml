Why should I use strictyaml instead of ordinary YAML?

StrictYAML is *not* a new standard. It's:

* YAML without implicit typing - `which was a terrible idea <https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml/blob/master/FAQ.rst#what-is-wrong-with-implicit-typing>`_.
* YAML with all of the `other bullshit removed <https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml/blob/master/FAQ.rst#what-features-does-strictyaml-remove>`_.
* An optional YAML validator.

If you already have YAML, StrictYAML will usually parse it.
